          <span>Subscriptions</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be
        billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are
        set on a monthly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact
        same conditions unless you cancel it or Sturdy cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
        renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Sturdy customer
        support team.
      </p>
      <p>
        A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your
        subscription. You shall provide Sturdy with accurate and complete billing information
        including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method
        information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Sturdy to
        charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Sturdy will issue an electronic
        invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the
        full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
      </p>
      <ol class="text-black font-bold" start="5">

          <span class="c0 c5">Free Trial</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Sturdy may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited
        period of time (“Free Trial”).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be
        charged by Sturdy until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless
        you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
        Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any time and without notice, Sturdy reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of
        Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

        Sturdy, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the
        Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the
        then-current Billing Cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sturdy will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to
        give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes

        <li>security purposes</li>
        <li>to assist the owner of a codebase with a support issue</li>
        <li>to maintain the integrity of the Service</li>
        <li>in order to comply with legal obligations</li>
        <li>if there is a reason to believe the contents illegal</li>

        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
        of&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

      <p>
        Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver
        of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a
        court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute
        the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior
        agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.

        We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we
        provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any
        reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
        time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users,

        We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. You will be

      <p>
        No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further
        or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition,
        and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a
        waiver of such right or provision.

      <p>
        If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to
        be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or
        limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in
        full force and effect.
