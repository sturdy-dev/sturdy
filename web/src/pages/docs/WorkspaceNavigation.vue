        , jumping between different work efforts is really easy. It takes a single click to move
        your development environment to another draft change, either yours or created by your team. All
        of this without losing any of your work in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are building Sturdy in order to make experimentation and collaboration on code easier.
        Instant draft change switching is particularly useful when you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suddenly spot something small that you wish to fix and deploy separately</li>
        <li>Would like to run somebody else's code on your machine</li>
        <li>Wish to make a code suggestion to your teammate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Compared to checking out different Git branches, switching between open draft changes is a very lightweight
        operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no need to stash your work in progress because Sturdy manages keeps track of every
        change automatically in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no need to add and fetch remotes in order to get your colleague's latest code
        because changes are always synchronized in real time.
