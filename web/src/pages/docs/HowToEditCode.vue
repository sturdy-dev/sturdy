        <p>
          With Sturdy, you access and edit your code with any local IDE or text editor &mdash; no
          different from what you are already used to.
        </p>

        <p>After you have created, imported or joined an existing codebase:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Navigate to the codebase by selecting it in the sidebar on the left.</li>
          <li>
            Connect a directory where you want to have the code by clicking the "Connect directory"
            button.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a directory where you want to have the code in. Sturdy will create a new
            directory inside the directory that you select with the same name as the codebase.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use the folder for accessing and editing code with any IDE or text editor
            <SubtleText>
              (tip: Use the "Open in Visual Studio Code"-button for quick access)
            </SubtleText>
          </li>
          <li>Observe that a new draft change named "Untitled Draft" was created</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Next steps:

        <DocsInfoBox>
          Any time you create code changes, they "happen" in a Sturdy draft change. Drafts provide
          isolation, just like Git branches &mdash; itâ€™s where you work. The main difference between
          Sturdy and others is the highly automated workflow that it enables.
        </DocsInfoBox>

        <p>
          As you write the code, you can see your changes in Sturdy, undo them,
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'v2DocsHowToCollaborateWithOthers' }"
          >ask for feedback
          </router-link>
          or
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'v2DocsHotToShipSoftwareToProduction' }"
          >ship them to production
          </router-link>
          &mdash; all of this is just a click away. You can read more about how Sturdy interacts
          with Git on
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'v2DocsHowSturdyInteractsWithGit' }">this page</router-link>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Coming soon:</em> It will be possible to toggle an auto-sync option on a draft change.
          With that enabled, you will always get the latest changes by others.
